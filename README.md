![Python 3.6](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.6-blue.svg)


## Welcome

The aim of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict sale price of houses, based on multiple explanatory variables describing aspects of these houses. The dataset used for this project is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).

## Organisation

This repository contains two directories : 
- R&D
- packages

The first directory contains all the jupyter notebooks and codes that led to the build of the package.

The second one contains the production code to perform our house price prediction as a python package.
